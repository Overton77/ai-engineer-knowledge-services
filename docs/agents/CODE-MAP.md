# Semantic code map

Generated from reviewed module descriptions and current selected source files. Package dependencies/exports/script names are extracted from manifests; relationships and ownership are authored. This is not a complete import graph or proof that a designed capability is implemented.

Paths below are repository-relative. Use the task routes, then search the module heading. Follow accepted architecture docs for decisions; proposed/reference/deprecated documents retain those labels.

## Task routes

- Change an HTTP/MCP/CLI verification surface: [contracts](#contracts) → [application](#application) → [api](#api) → [mcp](#mcp) → [cli](#cli)
- Change locator or evidence verification: [verification](#verification) → [verification-evidence-selection](#verification-evidence-selection) → [verification-deterministic](#verification-deterministic) → [verification-semantic](#verification-semantic)
- Debug worker retry or persistence: [worker](#worker) → [core](#core) → [persistence](#persistence)
- Change parsing and conversion: [preparation](#preparation) → [parser](#parser) → [docling](#docling)
- Change retrieval or embedding: [retrieval](#retrieval) → [policy](#policy)
- Find proof and evaluation commands: [script-proofs](#script-proofs) → [script-evaluation](#script-evaluation) → [script-reconciliation](#script-reconciliation)
- Change schema workspace, knowledge read, or ingestion: [knowledge-db](#knowledge-db) → [verification-executor](#verification-executor)

## Modules

| Module | Source | Responsibility | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| [api](#api) | apps/api | Fastify HTTP transport. createApiRuntime composes through createHost (role api) and maps host services onto buildServer. | implemented |
| [cli](#cli) | apps/cli | The ks binary: remote knowledge/verify/db commands call KnowledgeClient over HTTP; the verification intent pipeline runs on host's local file-store profile, loaded lazily; offline demo, attestation and benchmark utilities use application or verification on frozen files. pack:sandbox builds the installable ks tarball. | implemented |

## api

**apps/api** · app · implemented

Fastify HTTP transport. createApiRuntime composes through createHost (role api) and maps host services onto buildServer.

**Enter:** [`apps/api/src/index.ts`](../../apps/api/src/index.ts), [`apps/api/src/composition.ts`](../../apps/api/src/composition.ts), [`apps/api/src/server.ts`](../../apps/api/src/server.ts), [`apps/api/src/a2a-adapter.ts`](../../apps/api/src/a2a-adapter.ts)
**Interface:** Versioned HTTP endpoints over application use cases. Host composes persistence, operation ports, knowledge services and the shared verify group; composition.ts only maps host services onto buildServer options. Routes keep their historical problem titles over shared application reads (createKnowledgeResourceReads, createVerificationResourceReads), submitCanonicalRetrievalRun and bindResolvedVerificationContext. The A2A task binding (a2a-adapter.ts: task-to-operation mapping and A2AKnowledgeAdapter) lives here; callback signing and replay protection stay in application. The demo evaluation route loads bundles only through the optional loadDemoEvaluationBundles port (demo-evaluation-bundles.ts lazily imports the test kit, a devDependency).
**Package:** @aiengineer/knowledge-api ([`apps/api/package.json`](../../apps/api/package.json))
**Export subpaths:** none declared. Declared metadata; build outputs are not read.
**Declared internal package dependencies:** [application](#application), [contracts](#contracts), [core](#core), [host](#host), [persistence](#persistence), [retrieval](#retrieval)
**Other runtime dependencies:** fastify, zod
**Reviewed runtime/data relationships:** [host](#host), [persistence](#persistence)
**Checks:** [`apps/api/src/tests/server.test.ts`](../../apps/api/src/tests/server.test.ts), [`apps/api/src/tests/bootstrap.test.ts`](../../apps/api/src/tests/bootstrap.test.ts), [`apps/api/src/tests/host-lifecycle.test.ts`](../../apps/api/src/tests/host-lifecycle.test.ts), [`apps/api/src/tests/resource-reads.test.ts`](../../apps/api/src/tests/resource-reads.test.ts), [`apps/api/src/tests/a2a-adapter.test.ts`](../../apps/api/src/tests/a2a-adapter.test.ts) Package script names: build, dev, start, test, typecheck.
- The API route is the behavioral reference for MCP parity (apps/mcp/src/tests/api-mcp-parity.test.ts). Public-origin validation, credential resolution, callbacks, listeners, drift consumer routes and the serverless singleton stay in the API; close the server before the host.

## cli

**apps/cli** · app · implemented

The ks binary: remote knowledge/verify/db commands call KnowledgeClient over HTTP; the verification intent pipeline runs on host's local file-store profile, loaded lazily; offline demo, attestation and benchmark utilities use application or verification on frozen files. pack:sandbox builds the installable ks tarball.

**Enter:** [`apps/cli/src/index.ts`](../../apps/cli/src/index.ts), [`apps/cli/src/ks.ts`](../../apps/cli/src/ks.ts), [`apps/cli/src/ks-commands.ts`](../../apps/cli/src/ks-commands.ts), [`apps/cli/src/commands.ts`](../../apps/cli/src/commands.ts), [`apps/cli/src/local/offline.ts`](../../apps/cli/src/local/offline.ts)
**Interface:** ks <group> <command…>: KS_COMMANDS names every command and its one profile (remote, local, offline utility). Remote commands need an API URL and bearer and dispatch through KnowledgeClient (dispatchCliCommand); local commands map flags and KNOWLEDGE_LOCAL_* variables onto the local host's explicit identity and providers (no VERIFY_* names). Exit 0 success, 1 gate failed, 2 usage/auth/network/executor error, never a fallback. jev is reserved until 5F.
**Package:** @aiengineer/knowledge-cli ([`apps/cli/package.json`](../../apps/cli/package.json))
**Export subpaths:** none declared. Declared metadata; build outputs are not read.
**Declared internal package dependencies:** [application](#application), [client](#client), [contracts](#contracts), [host](#host), [verification](#verification), [verification-executor](#verification-executor)

- --help and remote commands must not load host, the executor seam, persistence or pg (bundle module-graph test). Do not fold local or mixed commands into dispatchCliCommand. The executor seam import (./local-verification) is transitional and goes with 5D3.

## mcp

**apps/mcp** · app · implemented

In-process Streamable HTTP MCP tools. createMcpRuntime composes through createHost (role mcp), which supplies the same knowledge, verify and operations groups as the API role; MCP never calls the API.

**Enter:** [`apps/mcp/src/index.ts`](../../apps/mcp/src/index.ts), [`apps/mcp/src/catalog.ts`](../../apps/mcp/src/catalog.ts), [`apps/mcp/src/tools/definition.ts`](../../apps/mcp/src/tools/definition.ts), [`apps/mcp/src/tools/errors.ts`](../../apps/mcp/src/tools/errors.ts), [`apps/mcp/src/tools/register.ts`](../../apps/mcp/src/tools/register.ts), [`apps/mcp/src/tools/executors.ts`](../../apps/mcp/src/tools/executors.ts), [`apps/mcp/src/server/http.ts`](../../apps/mcp/src/server/http.ts), [`apps/mcp/src/server/vercel.ts`](../../apps/mcp/src/server/vercel.ts)
**Interface:** MCP tool definitions are grouped under tools/ and checked against the application catalog at registration. Public names use the knowledge_* and verify_* command-group prefixes with no old aliases. index.ts composes the entrypoint; server/http.ts hosts Streamable HTTP and server/vercel.ts adapts the serverless request. Retrieval, evidence packet, citation replay, evaluation, vector-store status and every verification read/reconciliation tool call shared application reads; knowledge_retrieve_search calls submitCanonicalRetrievalRun. Verification mutations call VerificationOperationApplicationService.submit* after bindResolvedVerificationContext and the shared admission gates. Failures carry the API problem code; an absent capability is CAPABILITY_NOT_ADMITTED.
**Package:** @aiengineer/knowledge-mcp ([`apps/mcp/package.json`](../../apps/mcp/package.json))
**Export subpaths:** none declared. Declared metadata; build outputs are not read.
**Declared internal package dependencies:** [application](#application), [contracts](#contracts), [host](#host), [persistence](#persistence)
**Other runtime dependencies:** @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, fastify, zod

- No API client: MCP issues no HTTP request to the API and has no runtime @aiengineer/knowledge-client dependency. New tools call application use cases composed by host; keep tool names, schemas and authority outcomes in parity with the API route. KNOWLEDGE_API_URL only roots accepted-operation poll links. Every operation is classified in application operations/catalog.ts: exposed on API, MCP and CLI or excluded with a reason; declared kinds stay fail-closed.

## verification-executor

**apps/verification-executor** · app · implemented

Sandbox verification executor that also hosts schema, bounded-read, and ingestion operations on CLI, MCP, and HTTP.

**Enter:** [`apps/verification-executor/src/index.ts`](../../apps/verification-executor/src/index.ts), [`apps/verification-executor/src/executor.ts`](../../apps/verification-executor/src/executor.ts), [`apps/verification-executor/src/knowledge/operations.ts`](../../apps/verification-executor/src/knowledge/operations.ts), [`apps/verification-executor/src/knowledge/cli.ts`](../../apps/verification-executor/src/knowledge/cli.ts), [`apps/verification-executor/src/knowledge/context.ts`](../../apps/verification-executor/src/knowledge/context.ts), [`apps/verification-executor/src/operations/define.ts`](../../apps/verification-executor/src/operations/define.ts)
**Interface:** knowledge-verify plus knowledge schema_*/db_*/ingest_*/artifact_get; one OperationDefinition feeds CLI, POST /knowledge/<name>, and MCP. ./local-verification publishes the 5B file-backed seam for ks until 5D3.
**Package:** @aiengineer/knowledge-verification-executor ([`apps/verification-executor/package.json`](../../apps/verification-executor/package.json))

- Distinct from apps/api's durable service transport; preserve the explicit sandbox capability model. Knowledge services are absent when no database URL is configured.
- Agent claim/extraction intents select exact text quotes; native projection selector support in the library does not imply executor media admission.

## worker

**apps/worker** · app · implemented

Durable knowledge-operation execution and activity dispatch over host-composed adapters; verification runtime wiring stays in the worker execution factory.

**Enter:** [`apps/worker/src/index.ts`](../../apps/worker/src/index.ts), [`apps/worker/src/worker.ts`](../../apps/worker/src/worker.ts), [`apps/worker/src/activity-registry.ts`](../../apps/worker/src/activity-registry.ts)
**Interface:** startWorker composes through createHost (role worker): host builds adapters, reconciles before scheduling and owns release; the worker supplies activity execution, leases and receipts. Preserve lease ownership and idempotent terminal receipts.
**Package:** @aiengineer/knowledge-worker ([`apps/worker/package.json`](../../apps/worker/package.json))
**Export subpaths:** none declared. Declared metadata; build outputs are not read.

## client

**packages/client** · package · implemented

Out-of-process typed HTTP SDK (@aiengineer/knowledge-client, folder packages/client) for the Knowledge Services contract. Laptop CLI, Eve, Mission Control, and other repos. Not the long-term seam for API, MCP, or workers.

**Enter:** [`packages/client/src/index.ts`](../../packages/client/src/index.ts)

## host

**packages/host** · package · implemented

Composition root: configuration and identity resolution, shared knowledge and verification composition, createHost for the server roles (API, MCP, worker) and the file-backed local profile, with owned lifecycle and the server/local/remote-CLI capability matrix.

**Interface:** createHost({ profile: "server", role: api, mcp or worker }) returns role-typed services grouped as knowledge, verify and operations plus close(); createHost({ profile: "local", storeDir, providers?, verification }) composes the verification intent pipeline lazily over a file store: offline operations need no network, database or credentials; online capture, document conversion and semantic judging need explicit providers, else CAPABILITY_NOT_ADMITTED; other operations are server-only (profileAvailability). The verification seam is supplied by the executor until 5D3. composeKnowledgeServices and composeVerificationServices are shared by the API and MCP roles; verification/api/ holds read, reconciliation, decision, capture-profile and drift construction. @aiengineer/knowledge-host/config exposes configuration and identity; @aiengineer/knowledge-host/local exposes the local profile and capability matrix without the server composition (what ks loads); access rules are re-exported from application.

- No production dependency on persistence (R1); persistence remains a devDependency for database integration tests and fixtures.
- Consumes the committed workspace tree; it does not regenerate IR from the live database at request time.
- Retrieval operations are skipped (RETRIEVAL_UNAVAILABLE). Named queries and artifact ops run.
- space_manifest reports only its static half today: contract 0.4.16 has no space, store, version or publication catalog query, and no per-space budget exists at all. No executor operation is registered yet (Track K, after G3).
- Writes orchestration.operation_intent/receipt; does not write a knowledge_service.operation row.
