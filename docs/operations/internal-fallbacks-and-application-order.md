# Internal fallbacks, inspection, and application order

Status: **Proposed. Do not start implementation while another agent is changing Knowledge Services.**

This is the first concrete slice of the [post-sprint module review](code-quality-and-delivery-process.md). It records the high-level goal and the work order. It does not claim the fallbacks, the application folders, or the skill rewrite exist yet.

Conversion and chunking policy (accepted conceptually 2026-09-16) lives in the sibling [conversion route and admitted chunk profiles](conversion-and-chunking.md). This page keeps the work order and points there instead of restating the profile table.

## High-level goal

Give research agents a **reliable local path** to acquire source bytes, inspect them, convert them, and chunk them — without paying Firecrawl, Tavily, or Unstructured, and without treating those vendors as our product.

External providers stay first-class in the **agent framework** (their MCP servers and skills, attached by mission config when Mission Control exists). Knowledge Services owns **custody**: replayable bytes, observations, conversion of *already stored* artifacts, and a stop at the authority boundary.

When this slice is done:

1. HTTP download, local/operator upload, repo-at-SHA, and paper-identity fetch are clean, tested internal acquisition adapters.
2. Inspection is a real step: read, search, and record findings on sealed bytes. It does not convert, ingest, or publish.
3. Conversion fallbacks are clean: deterministic text first, **Docling Serve** as the deployed default, **Unstructured Transform** only when managed processing is allowed and paid.
4. Chunking is an admitted-profile preview on the sealed tree, not a session-local script. See the [sibling](conversion-and-chunking.md).
5. `packages/application` is ordered so a reader can find the use-case modules instead of a 160-file flat dump.
6. Skills are rewritten **last**, against the catalogs that actually exist, with provider-skill citations and worked examples.

Skills wait until the interfaces stop moving. Updating them now would teach the current mess.

## What each word means

| Word | Meaning | Not this |
|---|---|---|
| **Acquisition** | Get exact source bytes into tenant custody and seal a digest | Search snippets, Firecrawl markdown-as-evidence, conversion |
| **Inspection** | Look at those bytes and observations without promoting them | Vetting-as-acceptance, license/malware theater without recorded checks |
| **Conversion** | Turn a stored artifact digest into structural nodes | Fetching a URL, Unstructured/Docling as “acquisition tools” |
| **Chunking** | Slice sealed nodes with a named admitted profile | Session-local splitter, vendor elements written straight to `chunk_set` |
| **Application** | Admit the operation, account for it, persist receipts | Reimplementing HTTP or Docling inside use-case files |
| **External MCP** | Firecrawl, Tavily, Unstructured Transform in the agent toolbox | Nested inside Knowledge Services MCP |

Acquisition fetches. Inspection looks (twice: bytes, then nodes). Conversion structures. Chunking slices. Application admits and remembers.

## Provider composition (settled for this plan)

Do **not** compose vendor MCP servers into `@aiengineer/knowledge-mcp`.

```text
Mission config (later Mission Control)
  ├─ Firecrawl MCP / skill     research search and scrape
  ├─ Tavily MCP / skill        research search
  ├─ Unstructured Transform MCP / skill   paid partition
  ├─ Docling Serve             our conversion deploy
  └─ Knowledge Services MCP/CLI
        discover-account · import · acquire · inspect · convert · chunk · vet-propose
```

The handshake is **receipts**, not tool wrapping. An agent may use Firecrawl or Tavily, then `source import` a self-reported receipt. Host-held `source discover` remains the bounded exception (our schema, our budget, our redaction).

Unstructured’s current agent guidance prefers the [Transform MCP](https://docs.unstructured.io/agent-guide), then their Python SDK, then REST. We cite that skill. We do not re-host their server. We do not promote their retired open-source partition stack.

## Internal fallbacks we will make excellent

These are the adapters we own. They must be clean TypeScript (small interfaces, deep modules, no `any` at the seam) and demonstrable with fixtures. Default examples never need a paid key.

### Acquisition and inspection (including local download)

| Fallback | Job | Today | Desired |
|---|---|---|---|
| Exact HTTPS GET | Static URL → one sealed body | Strong library; only production-wired adapter | Keep as the default acquire path; document `knowledge.capture/v1` |
| Local / operator upload | File already on disk → attested bytes | Adapter exists, unwired | Wire as the local-download path: path safety, digest, rights attestation |
| Repository @ 40-char SHA | Immutable archive + manifest | Adapter exists, unwired | Wire only after capture can store archive + manifest (or a declared primary + observations) |
| Paper identity | DOI / arXiv / OpenReview → resolved PDF via HTTP | Normalizer exists; fetch unwired | Resolve identity, then HTTP-acquire the representation URL |
| Firecrawl scrape adapter | Host-held rendered fetch | Written, unwired, too product-shaped | Do **not** grow it. Thin scheduled/operator scrape only if KS must fetch with no agent. Agents use Firecrawl MCP + import |
| Inspection | Read/search/observe sealed bytes | Executor `verify_read_capture` / `verify_search_capture`; platform `source inspect` unsupported | Make inspection first-class: excerpt ≠ locator, findings recorded, no admission |

Inspection dimensions that may be recorded (not invented as “accepted”): identity conflict, declared vs observed media type, redirects, byte/replay integrity, license/rights *observations*, secret-*class* findings without secret values, extraction-loss notes. Platform `source vet` stays a **proposal**. It does not become acceptance.

Capture cardinality is an explicit decision before repo/Firecrawl-scrape wiring: either one primary body, or lift the worker’s `artifacts.length === 1` rule.

### Conversion

Already the right package (`packages/conversion`). Do not move Docling or Unstructured into acquisition.

| Fallback | Job | Policy |
|---|---|---|
| Deterministic text | Plain text and Markdown | Always first when the media type is native text |
| Docling Serve | PDF/HTML/Office on our deploy | Default conversion fallback; free to run, costs the box |
| Isolated verification parser | Quote-bearing PDF geometry / HTML DOM | Verification path; not a general converter |
| Unstructured Transform | Nasty documents | Only if `managedProcessingAllowed`; paid; credentials never in URLs or errors |

Today `ConversionRouter` tries managed Unstructured first when `managedProcessingAllowed`, then Docling. Desired order is the table above (Docling default, Unstructured gated). Cleanup flips that, pins versions, and makes the receipt (who ran, fallback used, fidelity) the thing skills teach. Detail: [conversion-and-chunking.md](conversion-and-chunking.md#conversion).

### Chunking

Already the right package (`packages/chunking`). Do not add a second splitter in application, skills, or the sandbox.

| Fallback | Job | Policy |
|---|---|---|
| Admitted profile registry | Slice sealed `DocumentNode`s | Only writer of custody-grade chunks. Agent **selects** `name@version`; package **runs** it. |
| Multi-profile per document | One tree, several spaces | `forSpace(space)` ∩ observed node kinds. Skip `table-row-groups-v1` when there are no tables. |
| QA + reconstructable spans | Replay and bounds | `qa.valid` required. Fail → next admitted profile or alternate converter. |
| Custom script | Skill example only | Inspect helper, QA diagnosis, or a JSON proposal for a **new named profile**. Never the chunk writer. |

Vendor MCP output is imported as stored artifacts, converted to our nodes, then chunked here. LlamaIndex / Unstructured elements do not write `retrieval.chunk_set`. Profile table, script rules, and the skill sequence: [conversion-and-chunking.md](conversion-and-chunking.md#chunking).

## Application order

`packages/application/src` is about **166 files** and a shallow `index.ts` barrel (~80 `export *` lines). The product modules are deep. The tree is not.

A read-only organization pass on 2026-09-16 (see the conversation map of `packages/application/src`) found:

**Keep and folder (deep use-cases):**

- `operations/` — capability catalogs, `KnowledgeOperationPort`, A2A
- `preparation/` — vet/preview, exploratory knowledge
- `source-discovery/` — managed/import/select accounting
- `checkpoints/`
- `promotion-selection/`
- `verification/admission/`
- `verification/operations/` — catalogs, parse, metrics, seal, claims, audit, adjudication, reads
- `verification/source-acquisition/` — grant-keyed HTTPS over acquisition ports (stays here; do not copy HTTP policy)
- `verification/recovery/`
- `verification/benchmark/` — registered run/compare/import only

**Quarantine, do not delete:**

- `diagnostics/` — the `verification-diagnostics-*` dump and the diagnostics host hiding inside `verification-benchmark.ts` (~34 + 34 files). CLI/scripts still need today’s export names.

**Do not move into acquisition, conversion, or `packages/verification`:** recovery, admission, claims, and source-acquisition use-cases. Those are orchestration modules. Algorithms stay in their packages.

**Worst leak to fix later:** persistence imports application *implementations* (hydrate/composer/result factories), not only ports. Invert that after the folder move.

### Application cleanup phases (safe order)

0. **Freeze the barrel.** No new `export *` while the other agent is working. New files join an existing module or stay unexported.
1. **Folder move only.** Same export names from `index.ts`. Zero consumer edits. Only phase that is merge-safe with transport work.
2. **Delete leftover `.d.ts`** beside live `.ts` (`verification-recovery.d.ts`, `verification-component-drift.d.ts`).
3. **Split `verification-benchmark.ts`.** Product benchmark stops importing diagnostics.
4. **Quarantine diagnostics** on the barrel; optional `./diagnostics` subpath later.
5. **Persistence type-only** application imports. Touches persistence + worker together — after folders.
6. **Optional subpaths** (`./operations`, `./verification`, `./source-discovery`). Keep `"."` until transports switch, mcp first.

Do not, in the same change: move files into other packages, rewrite worker preparation, or drop diagnostics export names.

**Hot files if another agent is active:** `index.ts`, `promotion-selection.ts`, `source-discovery.ts`, `checkpoints.ts`, `verification-recovery*.ts`, `verification-benchmark.ts`. Folder-move those last or coordinate.

## Work order (when the tree is free)

```text
1. Application folders (phase 0–1)     order, no behavior change
2. Acquisition + inspection fallbacks  HTTP, upload/local, inspect
3. Conversion fallback cleanup         Docling default, Unstructured gated
4. Chunk profile selection             multi-space select; QA fail-closed
5. Wire only what inspection can see   repo/paper after cardinality decision
6. Skills                              last
```

Steps 3–4 are specified in [conversion-and-chunking.md](conversion-and-chunking.md). Do not implement them while the other agent is in the tree.

Skills to update after the interfaces exist:

| Skill | What changes |
|---|---|
| `knowledge-acquisition-and-vetting` | Become acquisition **and inspection**. Split executor vs platform `source discover`. Cite Firecrawl/Tavily skills. Add cli/mcp/examples like verification. Document HTTP capture body. Say inspect ≠ admit. |
| `knowledge-preparation-and-promotion` | Conversion router: deterministic → Docling → Unstructured. Profile table, two inspections, `qa.valid`, no session-local splitter. Cite Unstructured Transform skill and our Docling deploy. CLI/MCP/examples like verification. |
| `knowledge-ingest` | Keep discovery receipts as inputs, not evidence. Cross-link; do not fork semantics. |
| `knowledge-verification` | Point at inspect/read-capture; do not re-teach acquire. |

`node skills/check.mjs` must pass. Examples use placeholder UUIDs and fixtures. Do not name unsupported platform commands (`source inspect` stays unsupported until it is admitted).

## Must-haves (developer-facing)

Recorded here so implementation does not invent product:

- Internal acquire works for a public static HTTPS URL and for a local file upload, with sealed digest and redacted observations.
- Inspection can read and search a sealed capture and return handles, not payloads.
- Conversion of plain text does not call Docling or Unstructured.
- Conversion of a PDF can succeed on Docling without an Unstructured key.
- Unstructured is never invoked unless managed processing is explicitly allowed.
- Chunk preview uses only an admitted profile, requires `qa.valid`, and can attach more than one profile when spaces and node kinds justify it.
- Failed chunk QA does not accept a session-local splitter.
- Vendor MCP is not a dependency of our MCP process.
- Application has named module folders; public export names still resolve from `@aiengineer/knowledge-application`.
- Skills describe the sequence and the two `knowledge` binaries after the above is true.

## Out of scope for this slice

- Mission Control mission-config wiring (record the contract; do not build MC here).
- Growing a second Firecrawl product inside acquisition.
- Session-local or vendor splitters as the chunk writer (see sibling).
- Making platform `source inspect` / `source compare` production-admitted before a persisted contract exists.
- Publication, retrieval, or ingestion behavior changes.
- Rewriting `packages/verification` algorithms.

## Coordination

Implementation waits until the in-flight Knowledge Services agent is done or this work is explicitly reassigned. Safe parallel work: documents and skills drafts that only cite current catalogs. Unsafe parallel work: `packages/application/src/index.ts`, persistence verification adapters, executor recovery/checkpoint hosts.

When work starts, recheck `git status` and this document against the tree. CODE-MAP’s application section is stale; trust the source barrel and the organization pass above.
