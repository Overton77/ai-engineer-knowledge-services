# Use this playbook

Use this sequence for schema facts, tenant-scoped knowledge, or a canonical
change. It is not permission to query or write. Start with the accepted
[preparation design](../docs/architecture/0002-deterministic-preparation.md).

# 1. Navigate the pinned schema first

Start with `schema_search`, then `schema_get` for the domain page before a
relation or function page. Search normalizes terms and ranks exact aliases,
names, terminology, partial aliases, then token overlap; it is a navigator,
not a database query. See
[`search.ts`](../packages/schema-workspace/src/search.ts) and its tests in
[`schema-workspace.test.ts`](../packages/schema-workspace/src/schema-workspace.test.ts).

Read the relevant rule and vocabulary files before composing an intent.
`schema_materialize` can use the db-contract CLI, a prebuilt bundle, or an
in-process filter; it records the chosen strategy and omitted items. See
[`materialize.ts`](../packages/schema-workspace/src/materialize.ts).
## Contract pins

The workspace manifest provides `migrationHead` and, when available, a
workspace fingerprint. `ReadExecutor.validateIntent` rejects an intent whose
declared pin disagrees with the loaded workspace. Before a database read, the
executor compares the workspace migration head with the database migration
head and fails closed on mismatch by default. See
[`workspace.ts`](../packages/schema-workspace/src/workspace.ts) and
[`head.ts`](../packages/schema-workspace/src/head.ts).

**Do not** copy a migration head from a different checkout or bypass a mismatch
for normal work. `allowStale` is documented in code as experiments only and is
recorded in the resulting snapshot.
# 2. Make a bounded, reproducible read

Create a `knowledge-read-intent.v1` with tenant context and named-query
operations. The catalog owns SQL, parameters, result shape, role ceiling, cost
class, and defaults. An operation can refer to a prior result with
`$<opId>...`; unresolved references skip it rather than silently substituting
a value. The contract is defined in
[`read-intent.ts`](../packages/db-read/src/read-intent.ts).

The executor validates duplicate operation IDs, catalog membership, parameter
schemas, role escalation, and limits before it touches the database. It then
uses a repeatable-read transaction, caps rows with one extra row to detect
truncation, and returns a per-operation digest. Read the implementation in
[`read-executor.ts`](../packages/db-read/src/read-executor.ts) and the
database proof in
[`read-executor.integration.test.ts`](../packages/db-read/src/read-executor.integration.test.ts).

| Need | Use | Result to retain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Catalog-backed tenant facts | Named-query read intent | `snapshotDigest`, `atKnowledgeSeq`, per-operation status/digest |
| A permitted diagnostic read | `db_sql_readonly` | Rows, cap/truncation flag, knowledge head, content digest |
| Query-cost inspection | `db_explain` | Plan under the same read-only guard |
| A durable input to ingestion | Read intent with `persist: true` | Snapshot artifact ID and intent artifact lineage |

Raw SQL is limited to one guarded read statement and runs as `pipeline_agent`.
It is not a mutation route. `SELECT` syntax alone is insufficient proof of
safety: database read-only enforcement is also tested in
[`read-executor.integration.test.ts`](../packages/db-read/src/read-executor.integration.test.ts).

## Interpret statuses

- `ok` and `empty` are completed reads; `truncated` means the cap hid rows.
- `skipped` can mean `REF_UNRESOLVED`, unavailable artifact bytes, or another
  explicit non-result. It is not equivalent to an empty query result.
- `error` is a contained query failure with a code and message.
- Returned snapshots have `headChanged: false` on this path. If the head changes
  inside the transaction, the executor aborts with `SNAPSHOT_HEAD_CHANGED`;
  the caller must retry the read intent.

`retrieval` operations are currently skipped as `RETRIEVAL_UNAVAILABLE` in
[`read-executor.ts`](../packages/db-read/src/read-executor.ts). Use the
separate retrieval service path; do not treat this status as a negative search
result.

# 3. Plan an ingestion intent

Compose `knowledge-ingestion-intent.v1` from a sealed evidence run and the
snapshot you just retained. The intent supplies `inputSnapshot`, its digest and
knowledge sequence, `expectedKnowledgeHead`, subjects, and proposals. Planning
writes no canonical data. It validates the evidence, vocabulary, rules,
subjects, snapshot preflight, and current head, then reports proposal outcomes,
rewrites, actions, and planned order. See
[`intent.ts`](../packages/ingestion/src/intent.ts) and
[`plan.ts`](../packages/ingestion/src/plan.ts).

Example shape:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "knowledge-ingestion-intent.v1",
  "intentId": "company-status-2026-09",
  "inputSnapshot": { "artifactId": "<snapshot>", "snapshotDigest": "sha256:<digest>", "knowledgeSeq": 42 },
  "expectedKnowledgeHead": 42,
  "onStale": "rebase_if_disjoint",
  "subjects": [{ "ref": "company", "mode": "resolved", "entityId": "<uuid>", "kind": "organization" }],
  "proposals": [{ "proposalId": "status", "kind": "fact.assert_state", "subjectRef": "company" }]
}
```

The real proposal must include all fields required by its kind, including
eligible evidence and temporal information where applicable. A draft plan is
the place to see a vocabulary failure, required review, a no-op duplicate, or
a rule rewrite before a write is attempted.

# 4. Apply once, then use the receipt

`IngestionExecutor.apply` rechecks preflight and applies admitted work through
the temporal helpers in one executor-service transaction. It records an
immutable receipt and relational receipt data. The receipt carries outcomes,
affected references, head before/after, and storage references; it is the
authority after an uncertain response. See
[`apply.ts`](../packages/ingestion/src/apply.ts),
[`executor.ts`](../packages/ingestion/src/executor.ts), and
[`executor.integration.test.ts`](../packages/ingestion/src/executor.integration.test.ts).

| Situation | Correct action | Do not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apply response was lost | Submit the identical intent and read the returned receipt/`duplicateOf`. | Create a new intent ID. |
| Head advanced before apply | Re-read and re-plan; only use `rebase_if_disjoint` when the planner proves no touched slot changed. | Force a stale `fail` intent through. |
| Rule or vocabulary rejects a fact | Correct the proposal or stage it for review. | Replace the code with guessed SQL. |
| A price correction targets an existing unit | Preserve the existing series key and inspect rewrites/supersedes. | Open a parallel live series. |

Tests cover response loss, duplicate handling, stale-head rejection, disjoint
rebase, snapshot forgery rejection, and existing price-series reuse.

# 5. Verify with a new read

Fetch a receipt when necessary, then issue a new named-query snapshot at the
current head. Compare the receipt's created/superseded references with the new
snapshot; a previous snapshot cannot prove a batch committed. The persisted
read path stores the intent and snapshot as separate ledger artifacts with a
`derived_from` link in
[`ReadExecutor.persist`](../packages/db-read/src/read-executor.ts).

# Current limitations

- Persistence of a read intent/snapshot is opt-in (`persist: true`); an
  ordinary snapshot has no artifact handle to cite later.
- Artifact operations can be skipped when the ledger or retained bytes are
  unavailable. Treat that as an explicit gap.
- The read executor's retrieval operation remains unavailable, while the
  separate `packages/retrieval` implementation provides a different path.
- Linked integration tests document expected behavior; running them requires
  their configured disposable database. Their presence is not a claim that
  those tests or a deployment were exercised by authoring this concept.
