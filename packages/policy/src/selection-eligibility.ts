 * rows, so one value is necessarily shared by two rows.
 *
 * `"node"` and `"chunk"` classify identically, because the contract itself
 * treats them as equally faithful source content, not as raw bytes versus
 * something else: `PromotionSelectionSchema`'s `superRefine` exempts both
 * `"chunk"` and `"node"` from the canonical-target identity match ("selected
 * canonical content must match its projection target" only applies to the
 * other four kinds), and it requires a `source_native_sections` member to be
 * `"chunk"` or `"node"` ("source-native sections require faithful source
 * content rather than derived projections"). A `node`-content candidate is
 * exactly what `packages/application/src/preparation/preparation.ts` builds
 * for a source-native section today, so reporting it as terminally
 * ineligible would mislead the S2 executor host this function exists to
 * inform. A candidate (of either kind) that supplies `locators` is
 * asserting reconstructable-locator fidelity — the faithful-section claim —
 * so it is classified `faithful_source_section`; one with no `locators` at
 * all is not making that claim and is classified `exploratory_draft`, the
 * agent's own working context.
 *
 * `raw_source_bytes` therefore has no `ContentReference.kind` value that
 * reaches it: a sealed capture is never itself a selection candidate (it is
 * what a faithful section or projection cites, not what gets proposed). The
 * kind stays in `RepresentationKind`, and `RAW_BYTES_STORED_NOT_EMBEDDED`
 * stays implemented below and reachable through the `default` branch,
 * purely to mirror `SPECIFICATION.md` §5.1 row 1 one-for-one and to fail
 * closed defensively if a future contract change, or a caller that bypasses
 * the type system, ever constructs a candidate whose `content.kind` is none
 * of the six known values. No candidate field was invented to make this
